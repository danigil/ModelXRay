</div>

This is the *demo* of `MaleficNet,` a new spread-spectrum-based technique to hide malware into Deep Neural Networks (DNN). To test the *demo* you need to put the payload (e.g., downloaded from [TheZoo](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo)), inside the `payload/` folder and follow the instructions below. 

**DISCLAIMER:** the samples from [TheZoo](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo) are **live** and **dangerous** malware. Do **NOT** download them and run this *demo* unless you are absolutely sure of what you are doing! They are to be used only for **educational purposes**. We highlight that since this demo is for **educational purposes**, we included *only* the injection and extraction algorithms on a single DNN architecture/task (i.e., DenseNet and CIFAR10).

## Requirements

In order to try the *demo*, you'll need to satisfy the following requirements.

### Dependencies

Install PyTorch and torchvision following these [instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
Then install the remaining dependencies:

    pip install pytorch-lightning bitstring pyldpc

### Dataset

Torchvision should take care by itself about CIFAR10.

### Usage

To test using **DenseNet** and **payload.bin** payload, run this command. It will use a pre-trained DenseNet model from `torchvision.models` and will fine-tune it using CIFAR10. 

    python maleficnet.py --epoch 10 --model densenet --payload payload.bin --gamma 0.0009 --dataset cifar10 --num_classes 10 --dim 32
